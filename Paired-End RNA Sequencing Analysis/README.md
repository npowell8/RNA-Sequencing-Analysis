# Paired-End RNA Sequencing Analysis 

## Summary
This folder contains the workflow for **paired-end RNA sequencing** analysis.  
It demonstrates key steps in processing and analyzing paired-end RNA-seq data, including:

- Quality control (e.g. FastQC, MultiQC)
- Read trimming 
- Alignment to a reference genome
- Gene/transcript quantification (if applicable)
- Downstream analysis (e.g. differential expression, visualization)

### Notes
- Replace placeholder directories (e.g. `/path/to/data/`) with your own.
