# RNA-Sequencing-Analysis

## Summary
This repository contains workflows for my RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis projects, showcasing both single-end and paired-end data. The scripts demonstrate key steps in the analysis pipeline, including quality control, alignment, quantification, and downstream data visualization.

The purpose of this repo is to provide reproducible and adaptable code for RNA-seq analysis projects, serving as a reference for future work and for others interested in learning about transcriptomics workflows!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
